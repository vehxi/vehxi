## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently hitting the books at uni, diving deep into Software Engineering.  
- ðŸŒ± Learning C# and .NET is my jam right now, but I'm also leveling up my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS.
- ðŸ’» Got a soft spot for C++ and algorithmsâ€”letâ€™s crack some code together!
- ðŸŽ¶ When Iâ€™m not coding, you can catch me vibing to tunes and discovering new beats. Music is life!

Feel free to connect and share some cool projects!
